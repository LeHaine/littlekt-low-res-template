My personal low res game base for the [LittleKt](https://github.com/littlektframework/littlekt) game framework that uses an
extension called [rune-kt](https://github.com/LeHaine/rune-kt). Great for LOWREZJAM and similar jams. Set up for 64x64 
resolution games.

Normally using the latest SNAPSHOT build instead of the latest stable.

More info on how to use this to come later.
